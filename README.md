# Broad Strokes - A Guide for the Young

This is a deeply personal project, born from a simple realization: too many young people grow up disconnected from the world around them.

## Why This Matters

Despite years of school, many teens graduate with facts but little understanding of how those facts connect to real life. They learn about history, science, literature, and society in separate boxes, never seeing how it all fits together. Only later do they realize that everything they studied was actually about the world they live in—but by then, they have to learn those connections all over again.

## What We're Building

This project aims to bridge that gap. We're creating a collection of writings for teenagers that paint the big picture—showing how history shapes today's world, how science affects daily life, how literature reflects human nature, and how society actually works.

The goal isn't to replace formal education, but to provide the context that often gets lost in traditional schooling. We want to help young people see the forest, not just the trees.

## A Personal Note

This project is for my two children, who are still too young to read these words but will someday need this understanding. It's also for every teenager who has ever wondered, "When will I actually use this stuff?"

This will take years to complete, and that's okay. Good things take time.

## How We're Making It Happen

We're embracing the power of AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude to make this project both possible and effective. These technologies allow us to create accessible, engaging content that might otherwise take decades to develop.
