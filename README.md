Broad Strokes - A guide for the young is a very important personal project. The idea is to create a reading guide, and in fact a collection of writings that teens can read, to get a broad view of the world. Too many kids grow up with very little understanding of the world they live in. Despite extensive school education, their factual knowledge may be large enough, but the system fails to contextualize most of it for them in their real life. Belatedly they realise that all they had learned in school pertained to the real world. But they still have to learn all the lessons all over again. I wish that this project helps them mitigate, if not entirely avoid, this fate. This is personal because it is aimed at my two little children who, while they are too young right now to read this, will eventually be old enough. And this project will take a long time to complete.

Thank god for the LLM technology now available to us - this project is at least feasible. I intend to extensively and shamelessly employ ChatGPT, Claude and any other generative AI tools that are available to make this entire project as effective as possible. Including this readme.
